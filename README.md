This is vanilla JS project. In this project, I implemented dynamic user interaction with the site. Created a custom slider, an application submission form, a calorie rate calculator, a timer, interaction with the server (sending a completed form and receiving a menu of cards). I used a modular approach and built the project through Webpack. There are several modules and services that are eventually assembled into one JS file.
